# toolbox-deps

This is a container with dependencies for running the [toolbox](https://github.com/chaotic-aur/toolbox)
on non-Arch distros.

The container is built on [Quay.io](https://quay.io/repository/chaotic/toolbox-deps) and is used by
the [wrappers](https://github.com/chaotic-aur/toolbox/tree/main/wrappers), which should be added to
the PATH of a non-Arch machine running the toolbox.
